To-do:

define simple test method for running single sentence with selected dictionary.
- cf.: parser.core.ParserTests.testLexicon_234_pt2().run

eventually defines as read-eval-print-loop

First, check how to speed up parsing.
- basically, how to make sure the compute n-best readings only
- linear parsing

Integration of GNTagger

Then, extract/load grammars
